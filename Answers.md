also try with a LinkedList - does it make any difference?-
it doesnt matter if you use arraylist or linkedlist because both use same methods


/ done what happens if you use list.remove(77)?-
if you use list.remove(77); it fails to  run because it tries to remove position 77 which there isnt because list is size 7.



 also try with a LinkedList - does it make any difference?(TestList)
 using a linkedList instead of ArrayList made no difference, every test worked regardless.

what does this method do?(TestList)
 removes index 5 from the list in this case it is 77

 // what does this one do? (TestList)
 removes the index that has a value of 5 being index 4

  // which of the two lists performs better as the size increases?

 as size increases time it takes for linked list takes a lot longer especially for access
